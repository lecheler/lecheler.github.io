# It's History Now

On the album, "[Brand New Flag](https://twocowgarage1.bandcamp.com/)," my friend Shane Sweeney from the great [Two Cow Garage](ok) sings:

>*"What if it is up to us?
<br/>I know it's difficult to think about it now
<br/>What if it is up to us to figure how the future all turns out?
<br/>Yeah, it's history now"*

The song is a rallying cry for agency at this moment in history. Indeed, history is a series of moments. It is not some nebulous past, and it is most certainly not a known future. My thoughts regarding the difficulties we are facing in America right now have been coalescing around problems of epistemology, or what it is to know something.
